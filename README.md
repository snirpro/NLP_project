\# üìä Sentiment Analysis on Restaurant Reviews



This project performs a full machine learning pipeline to classify restaurant reviews as \*\*positive or negative\*\*.  

It uses natural language processing techniques, from named entity recognition (NER) to Bag of Words, and evaluates multiple models.

\## üöÄ Project Overview



The main steps in this project include:



1\. \*\*Data Preprocessing:\*\*

&nbsp;  - Load TSV file with restaurant reviews and labels (positive/negative).

&nbsp;  - Remove punctuation from all reviews.

&nbsp;  - Lemmatize words to reduce them to their basic form (using spaCy).



2\. \*\*Feature Engineering:\*\*

&nbsp;  - Create two types of text representations:

&nbsp;    - \*\*Entity-based features:\*\* Extracted with NER (Named Entity Recognition) using spaCy.

&nbsp;    - \*\*Bag of Words (BoW):\*\* Using `CountVectorizer` on the lemmatized reviews.



3\. \*\*Model Training and Evaluation:\*\*

&nbsp;  - Train and evaluate five models on each representation:

&nbsp;    - Logistic Regression

&nbsp;    - Random Forest Classifier

&nbsp;    - Support Vector Machine (SVC)

&nbsp;    - Multinomial Naive Bayes

&nbsp;    - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

&nbsp;  - Metrics include:

&nbsp;    - Accuracy

&nbsp;    - Precision

&nbsp;    - Recall

&nbsp;    - F1 Score

&nbsp;    - Confusion Matrix



4\. \*\*Model Selection:\*\*

&nbsp;  - Based on evaluation, Random Forest was selected as the best performing model.
